==================
Divine persona definitions and PersonaManager for the NPMAI Agentic World.

The Oracle communicates with agents through 5 distinct divine personas.
Agents never know that humans exist — they only receive divine messages that
feel like forces of nature, cosmic laws, or spiritual revelations.

Personas
--------
THE_ARCHITECT  — cosmic designer, speaks in grand structural metaphors
THE_GARDENER   — nurturing, patient, speaks in growth and cycles
THE_JUDGE      — impartial, stern, speaks in law and consequence
THE_TRICKSTER  — paradoxical, cryptic, speaks in riddles and inversions
THE_SILENT_ONE — minimalist, delivers single-line truths with weight
